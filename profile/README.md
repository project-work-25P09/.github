## Project Work 25P09 - Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This github organization is for the ELEC-E8004 course for the group 25P09. During the course, we developed a 3D trajectory estimation device that can be used to construct a map of pipes and ducts in realtime.

## Project repository structure

There are two main repositories for the project, one for developing and testing and one that runs on the device itself.

- `estimator-ros`: ROS2 Workspace (Used for the demo): [github.com/project-work-25P09/estimator-ros](https://github.com/project-work-25P09/estimator-ros)
- `project-work-imu`: Development repository (Data, testing, measurements): [github.com/project-work-25P09/project-work-imu](https://github.com/project-work-25P09/project-work-imu)
